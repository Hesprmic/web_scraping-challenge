# web_scraping-challenge
Scraped the titles and previews from the Mars News site using HTML code and Beautiful Soup in Jupyter Notebook. Imported Selenium instead of Splinter. Then I web-scraped and anyalyzed the Mars Weather Data using Pandas to answer the questions posed in the module 11 homework. The data was analyzed, questions were answered and the DataFrame was exported to a csv file as requested. This was a perfect amount of difficulty for where I am at in the course and a welcomed "breather". I did find the last homework to be very challenging!
**NOTE-had error doing final edit git push. Was attempting to clean up an unnecessary code left in my Jupyter notebook files. Hopefully they are clean enough. Apologies.
